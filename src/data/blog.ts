## The Problem
Most developer portfolios hardcode content directly into components, making updates tedious.

## The Solution
Separate your content from UI. Keep all data in TypeScript files and let components render it.

### Benefits
- **Easy Updates**: Change data, not code
- **Scalability**: Add sections without touching components
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

## Less is More
In today's web, complexity often equals confusion.

## Core Principles
1. **Whitespace** - Breathing room for content
2. **Color** - One primary accent color
3. **Typography** - Two font families maximum
